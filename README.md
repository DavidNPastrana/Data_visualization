Title: [Exploring Sleep Quality: A Comparative Analysis of Occupations, Ages, and Genders](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.nunez2187/viz/quality_sleep_David_2/Story1?publish=yes)


## 1. Project Description.

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis and derive valuable insights from the data related to sleep quality. The project encompasses extracting and transforming data to facilitate the exploration of the relationship between sleep quality and various variables, including occupations, genders, and other relevant factors. By thoroughly examining these relationships, the project seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing sleep quality and provide valuable insights for further research and potential interventions.


## 2. Data Extraction

The data for this project has been obtained from [Kaggle:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset) as a CSV document. Kaggle is a widely recognized platform for accessing and sharing datasets from various domains. The dataset chosen for this project specifically focuses on sleep health and lifestyle. The CSV format allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the data using tools like Pandas and NumPy.


## 3. Data Cleaning and Transformation

The dataset used in this project required minimal cleaning and transformation as it was already in a relatively suitable format for analysis and visualization. A few minor adjustments were made to ensure the dataset's readiness for Tableau and subsequent data exploration. These adjustments primarily focused on handling any missing values and standardizing variable names or formats, ensuring consistency throughout the dataset. Overall, the cleaning process was relatively straightforward due to the dataset's initial quality, allowing for efficient data analysis and visualization in Tableau.


## 5. Data Analysis

The data was initially analysed using pandas Python libraries, which included an calculation correlation between variables.

Tableau was use to generate scatter plots, bar charts, and more. These analytical methods were employed to gain insights and examine relationships within the dataset.

Based on the analysis, several conclusions can be drawn:

-  

- 

These findings provide valuable insights into the relationships between safety, religiosity, and happiness, highlighting the complex dynamics involved in determining a country's overall happiness.
